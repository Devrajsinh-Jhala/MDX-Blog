**Server-side rendering (SSR)** is a technique used to generate and serve HTML pages from the server in response to a client's request. With server-side rendering, the server is responsible for creating the initial HTML markup of a webpage, which is then sent to the client's browser.

In contrast, **client-side rendering (CSR)** is where the client's browser is responsible for rendering the HTML and other assets necessary to display a webpage. In CSR, the server only provides the initial HTML, JavaScript, and other assets to the client, which then loads and runs these resources to render the page.

The main advantage of server-side rendering is that it provides faster initial page load times and better search engine optimization (SEO). When a user requests a page, the server generates the complete HTML content of the page and sends it to the client, which can then display the page without waiting for additional resources to be loaded. This reduces the perceived page load time and provides a better user experience.

In addition, server-side rendering can improve SEO because search engines can crawl and index the complete HTML content of the page. This means that search engines can more easily understand the content of the page and provide more accurate search results.

However, server-side rendering can be more resource-intensive on the server because it must generate the HTML for each request. This can lead to slower response times and higher server load compared to client-side rendering.

In summary, server-side rendering is a technique used to generate and serve HTML pages from the server, providing faster initial page load times and better SEO, but can be more resource-intensive on the server.
